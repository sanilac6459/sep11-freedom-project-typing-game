# sep11-freedom-project-typing-game

Hello! We present to you our project, Keysanity typing game. For this year's freedom project, we learned Javascript and our tool P5js to create this fun and interactive game for people to type quickly and efficiently.

Here’s how you play: there are directions in the intro on how to start. Once you click the start button, type exactly the displayed word and press enter or return to proceed.

Our game will check and display the typed words based on the user's spelling.
